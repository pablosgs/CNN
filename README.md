# CNN

Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network in Python for a classifier of MNIst digits.

First, a non-vectorized manual implementation of the convolution operation.

Then, a simple CNN implementation for MNISt digit classification.

Last, a variable resolution CNN, that can handle input of different dimensions.
